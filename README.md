Reddit has many good links. One is the [Imaginary Network: Expanded](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginary/), that encompasses about 100 different subreddits, each dealing with a specific aspect, such as:

* [Imaginary Architecture ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryArchitecture/)
* [Imaginary Derelicts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryDerelicts/)
* [Imaginary Futurism](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryFuturism/)
* [Imaginary Starships](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryStarships/)

In addition there is the [Imaginary Network](https://www.reddit.com/user/One_Giant_Nostril/m/imaginarynetwork/). It is not part of the Expanded network, but has a few high-traffic collections such as:

* [Imaginary Landscapes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryLandscapes/) (about half sci-fi, half fantasy)
* [Imaginary Technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/)

#### Music
