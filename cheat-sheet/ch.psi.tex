\begin{eptable}{ l | X }
   \rndheader{2}{Sleights}
   Psi-Chi & Always on.\\
   Psi-Gamma & Require action \& Psi-Test.\\
\end{eptable}

\begin{eptable}{ l | X }
   \rndheader{2}{Opposed Psi Test}
   Defender Wins Critical & Async locked out.\\
   Async Wins Critical & Double effect or damage, or half Psi armor.\\
   Async Fails Critical & \sv{1d6 + strain} \& ruptured blood vessels.\\
\end{eptable}

\begin{itemize}
    \itembox Target opposes with \skill{WIL}. May go full psychic defense as complex action to gain \modifier{+30}.
    \itembox Target aware \textit{something} is happening every time it wins it's Psi test.
    However, very unlikely it understands that targeted by Psi unless Async itself.
\end{itemize}

\begin{eptable}{ l | X }
   \rndheader{2}{Targeting}
   Multiple Targets & Single roll vs. multiple opposed. IR \modifier{+5} per target more.\\
   Animals & Partially sapient \modifier{-20}, non-sapient animals \modifier{-30}.\\
   Aliens & At least \modifier{-20}, might not work at all.\\
\end{eptable}

\begin{eptable}{ l | X }
   \rndheader{2}{Psi Range}
   Self & Only the Async.\\
   Touch & Physical contact. For touch attack \modifier{+20}, do dmg., same action.\\
   Close & Beyond \SI{10}{m} gives \modifier{-10} per meter.\\
   Psi vs Psi & Touch becomes Close, Close \SI{20}{m}.\\

\end{eptable}


\bigskip

\begin{eptable}{ l | X }
   \rndheader{2}{Duration}
   Constant & Always on.\\
   Instant & Immediate and permanent.\\
   Temporary & Lasts \skill{WIL} + 5 time units, as defined in sleight.\\
   Sustained & Requires concentration, \modifier{-10} to Async for duration.\\
\end{eptable}

\begin{itemize}
    \itembox Multiple sleights might be sustained at same time, each incurring additional \modifier{-10}.
    \itembox Async must also stay within range.
\end{itemize}
