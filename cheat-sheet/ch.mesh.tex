\subsection*{Searches}

\begin{itemize}
   \itembox Looking up common information on mesh is instant and does not require roll.
   \itembox Searches for non-common information on local mesh have timeframe of \SI{1}{h}, and might be complemented by appropriate \skill{Know} skill. Searches outside of the local mesh increase time frame due to distance lag.
   \itembox Superior successes provide more nuanced information, critical success leads to breakthrough understanding, critical failure to false or misleading information.
   \itembox \skill{Research} only yields information. Understanding data might require \skill{Know} test or similar.
   \itembox Searching non-public information (located on specific host or sub-net) requires appropriate access and has special time frame (see table). Encrypted files must be decrypted before they can be searched.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Physical Tracking}

\begin{itemize}
   \itembox Physical tracking by mesh ID is \skill{Research} and can yield location of target and is instant. If they are in private mode \modifier{-30} modifer, opposed vs \skill{Infosec} if they cycle mesh IDs, timeframe \SI{1}{h}.
   \itembox Biometrical tracking is handled as \skill{Perceive} or \skill{Research}, possibly opposed by \skill{Infiltrate} or \skill{Disguise}.
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[htbp!]%
   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{gfx/mesh-search-biometric}%
\end{figure}%

\subsection*{Mesh Tracking}

\begin{itemize}
   \itembox Public information easily accessible, private info might require \skill{Research} scraping at \modifier{-30}, favors, or special database access.
   \itembox Live activity tracking can generally be difficult (\skill{Research} at \modifier{-30}) or impossible even if mesh ID is known. Better approach is to sniff traffic or hack their PAN. Tracking activity on particular system can be done with elevated accounts.
   \itembox Countermeasures are burner mesh IDs, disposable Ectos, VPNs, anonymizing proxies and spoofing mesh IDs.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Intrusion}

\begin{eptable}{ l | X }
   \epheader{2}{Ways of Hacking}
   Circumvent Authentication & Gain or forge access tokens.\\
   Spoofing & Intercept traffic and impersonate user.\\
   Intrusion & Find exploits to gain access.\\
\end{eptable}

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
   \itembox Intrusion first requires a direct connection, either wirelessly (need to know target mesh ID), via an access port, or via tapping into a cable (\skill{Hardware: Electronics}).
   \itembox Brute force hacking is complex action, Hacking test, at \modifier{-30}. If successful get user access level (each superior upgrades access level). Attacker is in \textit{spotted} status, system goes into alert. On critical success \textit{covert} status.
   \itembox Subtle hacking has \SI{1}{h} task action, success grants user access level.
\end{itemize}

   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{gfx/mesh-firewall}%
\end{figure}%


\begin{eptable}{ l | X }
   \epheader{2}{Intruder Status}
    Hidden & System completely unaware. Get +10 to subvert system.\\
    Covert & System aware of presence, but does not consider threat.\\
    Spotted & System considers threat, launches countermeasures.\\
\end{eptable}

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
   \itembox Can spend complex action \skill{Hacking} to try to upgrade status. Does not erase logs, but makes harder to pinpoint attacker.
   \itembox Any \skill{Infosec} while within system risks exposure. Superior failure triggers passive alert, critical failure spotted status.
   \itembox To pinpoint intruder on passive alert, system may do opposed \skill{Infosec} against intruder. If successful, system goes active alert.
\end{itemize}


\begin{eptable}{ l | X }
   \epheader{2}{Security Alerts}
    Passive Alert & Notifies admin, might launch passive CM, usually \SI{10}{m} cooldown.\\
    Active Alert & Launches active CM, attacker suffer \modifier{-10}.\\
\end{eptable}

\bigskip

\begin{eptable}{ l | X }
   \epheader{2}{Passive Countermeasures}
    Backup & Back up all critical information to prevent deletion.\\
    Egress Filtering & Block outgoing transfers (contest w. \skill{Hacking}).\\
    Locate Intruder & Try to zero in on intruder in system.\\
    Reduce Privileges & Reduce access rights of standard users.\\
\end{eptable}

\bigskip

\begin{eptable}{ l | X }
   \epheader{2}{Active Countermeasures}
    Counter Intrusion & Try to back-hack intruder if identified.\\
    Crash and Lockout & Crash intruder shell and prevent further access.\\
    Reboot or Shutdown & Takes \dice{1d6} actions or minutes.\\
    Terminate Connections & System can't be accessed anymore.\\
    Trace & Try to identify attacker's physical location.\\
\end{eptable}

\end{eptable}

Subversion is usually handled as \skill{Hacking} test.

\subsection*{Mesh Combat}

\begin{itemize}
   \itembox Works somewhat like regular combat. \textbf{Local attacks} require access and account on system and can attack entities on system. \textbf{Remote attacks} attack operating systems of remote devices, but cannot attack infomorphs, cyberbrains, or software running on them.
   \itembox Attack is complex \skill{Infosec}. If local attack and you do not have admin, you suffer \modifier{-30}. If system is shielding, opposed \skill{Infosec} roll. Remote attacks are opposed by \skill{Firewall} or defender \skill{Infosec}.
   \itembox Attacks are not obvious but rather glitches. Victim can't fight back unless \skill{Infosec} complex action to identify attacker.
   \itembox Mesh damage is \dice{2d10}, added \dice{1d6} per superior, double for critical.
   \itembox Wound mechanic similar to regular wounds, including cumulative \modifier{-10} modifier. Each wound causes cumulative \SI{10}{\%} chance for system glitch.
   \itembox Apps can't heal and need to restart. Infomorphs and others heal \dice{1d10} or 1 wound per minute.
\end{itemize}

    4 & Memory Loss. Might lose file, memory or skill until reboot.\\
    5 & Hung Process. App or synthmorph system might stop working.\\
    6 & Overload. Can't use pool for \dice{1d6}, or function every other round.\\
